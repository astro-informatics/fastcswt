<P>
The FastCSWT package provides functionality to perform a directional
continuous wavelet transform on the sphere.  The transform is based on
the construction of the continuous spherical wavelet transform (CSWT)
developed by <a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science?_ob=ArticleURL&_udi=B6WB3-45HR76Y-2&_user=10&_rdoc=1&_fmt=&_orig=search&_sort=d&view=c&_acct=C000050221&_version=1&_urlVersion=0&_userid=10&md5=5753d337cd12f8a8cb76210523ac954d">Antoine and Vanderghynest 1999</a>.  A fast implementation
of the CSWT (based on the fast spherical convolution developed by <a
href="http://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0008227">Wandelt and Gorski
2001</a>) is also provided.  The fast algorithm in the context of the
CSWT, and as implemented in this package, is described in our paper:

<blockquote>
J. D. McEwen, M. P. Hobson, D. J. Mortlock, and
A. N. Lasenby.

algorithms</a>.
IEEE Trans. Sig. Proc., 55(2):520-529, 2007.
</blockquote>
</p>

<P>
The library design is based on object-oriented principles and is
implemented in Fortran 90.  Generally one must instantiate a class
object using the corresponding init routines.  The instatiated object
should be freed once it is no longer required with the corresponding
free routine (this deallocates all memory associated with the object).

<p>
For further details see the
<a href="http://github.com/astro-informatics/fastcswt">README.txt</a>
file.




<HR>
<H2> Installation </H2>

<p>
The FastCSWT package requires the
<a href="http://www.jasonmcewen.org/codes.html">S2</a>,
<a href="http://healpix.jpl.nasa.gov/">HEALPix</a>,
<a
href="http://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/software/fitsio/fitsio.html">CFITSIO</a>
and
<a href=http://www.fftw.org>FFTW 2.1.5</a>
packages.  Please note that all FastCSWT code is written in
Fortran 90 and a suitable Fortran compiler will be required.


<H3> Compiling library </H3>

Before compiling you may need to edit the <a href="../makefile">makefile</a> to specify your
compiler and to link with the appropriate libraries.  Once you have
set the makefile up for your system then the FastCSWT library may be
compilied by running:
<blockquote>   
<code> >> make lib</code>
</blockquote>

<p>
For details on how to use the FastCSWT library code see the documentation
<a href="#library">below<a>.

<H3> Compiling utility programs </H3>
<p>
The FastCSWT utility programs may be compiled by running:
<blockquote>   
<code>>> make prog</code>
</blockquote>

For details on how to use the FastCSWT utility programs see the documentation
<a href="#utility">below<a>.

<H3> Documentation </H3>
<p>
By default, the FastCSWT code ships with only this single documentation
page.  The remainder of the documentation is automatically generated
from the source code using 
<a href="http://theory.lcs.mit.edu/~edemaine/f90doc/">f90doc</a>.  
Please ensure that you have f90doc installed in order to generate this
documentation.  Once f90doc is installed the documentation may be 
generated by running:
<blockquote>   
<code>>> make docs</code>
</blockquote>

<H3> Cleaning up </H3>

To clean up your version of the FastCSWT code and return all code to its
original state run:
<blockquote>   
<code>>> make clean</code>
</blockquote>

To remove all documentation, except the front page (i.e. this file),
run:
<blockquote>   
<code>>> make cleandocs</code>
</blockquote>

<a name="library"><H2> Library classes </H2></a>



An overview of the classes that comprise the FastCSWT library is given
here.  Please click on the link for each class for detailed
documentation. 

<p>
<CODE><a href=cswt_tr_mod.html>cswt_tr_mod</a></CODE>: 
 Provides functionality to support and compute the directional
 spherical wavelet transform. In addition the mother wavelet, the
 dilation values and all wavelet parameters are stored herein. The
 resulting wavelet coefficients for each dilation are sampled on an
 ecp (equi-sampled) alpha-beta-gamma Euler angle grid. Functionality
 is also provided to convert the alpha-beta dimensions to Healpix sky
 representations and vice versa.

<p>
<CODE><a href=cswt_swav_mod.html>cswt_swav_mod</a></CODE>: 
 Provides functionality to support and manipulate a spherical
 wavelet. The spherical wavelet data structure includes the wavelet
 sky plus its parameters. 

<p>
<CODE><a href=cswt_tmpl_mod.html>cswt_tmpl_mod</a></CODE>: 
 Contains definitions of template functions defined on both the sky
 and the plane used to initialise spherical wavelets. The functions
 defined on the plane are projected onto the sphere numerically,
 whereas those functions defined on the sphere have already been
 analytically projected from the plane. 

<p>
<CODE><a href=cswt_error_mod.html>cswt_error_mod</a></CODE>: 
 Functionality to handle errors that may occur in the FastCSWT
 library. Public FastCSWT error codes are defined, with corresponding
 private error comments and default halt execution status. 


<HR>
<a name="utility"><H2> Utility programs </H2></a>

A number of generic programs based on the FastCSWT library have been
written.  Please click on the link for each program for detailed
documentation. 

<P>
<CODE><a href=cswt_analysis.html>cswt_analysis</a></CODE>: 
 Perform fast directional continuous spherical wavelet transform.

<P>
<CODE><a href=cswt_mask_apply.html>cswt_mask_apply</a></CODE>: 
 Apply an extended coefficient exclusion mask to wavelet coefficients.

<P>
<CODE><a href=cswt_mask_copy.html>cswt_mask_copy</a></CODE>: 
 Generate a coefficient exclusion mask defined in the ecp wavelet
 coefficient domain by simply converting a list of Healpix sky mask to
 the wavelet domain. 

<P>
<CODE><a href=cswt_mask_gen.html>cswt_mask_gen</a></CODE>: 
 Generate an extended coefficient exclusion mask defined in the ecp
 wavelet coefficient domain from an original mask defined on the sky
 and the spherical wavelet transform of the original mask.

<P>
<CODE><a href=cswt_mask_invert.html>cswt_mask_invert</a></CODE>: 
 Invert a coefficient mask by converting ones to zeros, and zeros to
 ones.

<P>
<CODE><a href=cswt_mask_nonzero.html>cswt_mask_nonzero</a></CODE>: 
 Compute number of effective coefficients in an extended coefficient
 exclusion mask and write results to either the standard output or to
 a file.

<P>
<CODE><a href=cswt_mask_nonzero_weight.html>
cswt_mask_nonzero_weight</a></CODE>: 
 Compute the weighted number of effecitve coefficients in the extended
 coefficient mask. Weights for each pixel are given by the size of the
 pixel on the sky for the ECP wavelet coefficient domain. 

<P>
<CODE><a href=cswt_plot_swav.html>cswt_plot_swav</a></CODE>: 
 Plot spherical wavelet for a range of dilations.

<P>
<CODE><a href=cswt_swav_azbandlim.html>cswt_swav_azbandlim</a></CODE>: 
Determine azimuthal band limit of wavelet.

<P>
<CODE><a href=cswt_tr2sky.html>cswt_tr2sky</a></CODE>: 
  Convert a spherical wavelet transform fits file (ecp sampled) to a
  sky Healpix fits file. Just the sky corresponding to a specified
  dilation and orientation index may be written, or skies
  corresponding to all dilations and orientations may be written.

<P>
<CODE><a href=cswt_tr_nsigma.html>cswt_tr_nsigma</a></CODE>: 
 Convert wavelet coefficients to nsigma values. The coefficient map
 for each dilation is considered; the mean for each dilation is
 subtracted, before dividing by the sigma value computed for that
 dilation. Note that the mean and sigma are only computed over the
 non-masked pixels.
