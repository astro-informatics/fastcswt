                          FastCSWT PACKAGE
   A fast directional continuous wavelet transform on the sphere
  ---------------------------------------------------------------

DESCRIPTION 
     This package provides functionality to perform a directional
     continuous wavelet transform on the sphere.  The transform is
     based on the construction of the continuous spherical wavelet
     transform (CSWT) developed by Antoine and Vanderghynest 1999.  A
     fast implementation of the CSWT (based on the fast spherical
     convolution developed by Wandelt and Gorski 2001) is also
     provided.  The fast algorithm in the context of the CSWT, and as
     implemented in this package, is described in our related paper:
     McEwen et al. 2007.
